# GaussianNaiveBayes
Gaussian Naive Bayes implementation on the UCI Machine Learning SpamBase Dataset

# Overview
This implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is done for assignment for cs445 at 
Portland State University.
This implementation takes the spambase dataset, splits it into two separate parts for training and testing
with proportionate probability, and runs the algorithm on the halves.

# Requirements
	- Python 3.4.2
	- The UCI Spambase dataset, 'spambase.data' 
	
This implementation does not use numpy or any external libraries.  You can plug and play this code as long as 
the .py file and the 'spambase.data' file are in the same directory
